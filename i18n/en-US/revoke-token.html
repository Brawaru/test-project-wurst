<p>Revoking your Modrinth token can have unintended consequences. Please be aware that the following could break:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any application that uses your token to access the API.</li>
  <li>Gradle - if Minotaur is given a incorrect token, your Gradle builds could fail.</li>
  <li>GitHub - if you use a GitHub action that uses the Modrinth API, it will cause errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are willing to continue, complete the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li><revoke-link>Head to the Modrinth Application page on GitHub.</revoke-link> Make sure to be logged into the GitHub account you used for Modrinth!</li>
  <li>Press the big red "Revoke Access" button next to the "Permissions" header.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have completed those steps, press the continue button below.</p>
<p>
  <strong>This will log you out of Modrinth, however, when you log back in, your token will be regenerated.</strong>
